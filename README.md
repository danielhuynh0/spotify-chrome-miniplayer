## Spotify Mini-Player for Chrome
**Currently in development mode**

I always listen to music while working. This means spending lots of hours with Google Chrome open. However, each time I want to check what song is currently playing, I have to manually open my Spotify app to check. This extension allows me to see the music currently playing, pause, rewind, and skip without having to take my hands off of my mouse.
### To use:
- Download the `spotify-extension` folder
- Go to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser
- Turn on developer mode
- Click `Load unpacked` and select the `spotify-extension` folder you just downloaded
- Open a new tab, and start listening!
